**Problem Statement:**

We all have seen people migrating back to their home towns during this Pandemic (Covid-19) as they were unemployed. 
We also noticed that many renowned personalities helped the people, especially the labours to reach back to their homes safely. 
And now, at present, as we all are trying to get back to the normal life, 'a question arises!' 
The question is: *Who will support these people in the post COVID-19/ post pandemic phase?*
As the world has started gearing up again, People need jobs to earn the daily living. 
Yes, we have some very well platforms for work like entrepreneurship, mass media, engineering, management and many more, but what about the labours and the workers? Who, at present, can't take the risk of going out from their local areas but at the same time can't avoid going out in search of work, to earn the daily wages. Also, its not sure that they will have their old job with them! So, what about that?

**Solution:**

For the people, who are famished, for the Labours who are strong but the conditions have made them weak, we have stretched our hands for those who are in need!
Our platform will provide work to these people. They can access our website and search for the work of their intrest or the work in which they are skillfull. 

Jobs can be easily accessible to the people and communication will be made easy between the two- parties (no physical contact required). Also, the travel time to search a job in local area will be no more in existence. People will get aware about jobs for them nearby. Also, the stress and tension because of “how to earn daily wages?” post Covid-19 will be reduced by this platform. 

*So, the ultimate goal is to provide work to the people by thier own people at small levels. This will also promote "Vocal for Local"*
